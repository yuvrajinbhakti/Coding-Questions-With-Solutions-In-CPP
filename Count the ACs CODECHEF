Problem Code:ACS
Contest Code:JUNE222
Difficulty Rating:739
There are 10 problems in a contest. You know that the score of each problem is either 1 or 100 points.

Chef came to know the total score of a participant and he is wondering how many problems were actually solved by that participant.

Given the total score P of the participant, determine the number of problems solved by the participant. Print −1 in case the score is invalid.
Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line containing a single integer P - denoting the number of points scored by the participant.
Output Format
For each testcase, output the number of problems solved by the participant or -1 if the score is invalid.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
0 ≤ P ≤ 1000
Sample 1:
Input
5
103
0
6
142
1000
Output
4
0
6
-1
10
Explanation:
Test Case 1: The participant has solved 4 problems out of which 3 problems are worth 1 point each while 11 problem is worth 100 points.
Test Case 2: Since participant's score is 0, he solved 0 problems.
Test Case 3: The participant has solved 6 problems out of which all the problems are worth 1 point.
Test Case 4: It is not possible to get a score of 142.
Test Case 5: The participant solved all the 10 problems and score of all the problems is 100.
