/*
Qualify the round
Problem Code:QUALIFY
Contest Code:START28
Difficulty Rating:594

In a coding contest, there are two types of problems:

Easy problems, which are worth 1 points each
Hard problems, which are worth 2 points each

To qualify for the next round, a contestant must score at least X points. Chef solved A Easy problems and BB Hard problems. Will Chef qualify or not?
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing three space-separated integers — X,A, and B.
Output Format
For each test case, output a new line containing the answer — Qualify if Chef qualifies for the next round, and NotQualify otherwise.
Each character of the answer may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. For example, if the answer is Qualify, outputs such as qualify, quALiFy, QUALIFY and QuAlIfY will also be accepted as correct.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X ≤ 100
0 ≤ A, B ≤ 100

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Chef solved 9 easy problems and 3 hard problems, making his total score 9⋅1+3⋅2=15. He needs at least 15 points to qualify, which he has and hence he qualifies.

Test Case 2: Chef solved 33 easy problems and 00 hard problems, making his total score 3⋅1+0⋅2=3. He needs at least 5 points to qualify, which he doesn't have and hence doesn't qualify.

Test Case 3: Chef solved 22 easy problems and 88 hard problems, making his total score 2⋅1+8⋅2=18. He needs at least 6 points to qualify, which he has and hence he qualifies.
